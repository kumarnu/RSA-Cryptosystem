# RSA-Cryptosystem
Write a C++ program that involves implementing the RSA cryptosystem. Also, rather than using the ASCII table for this assignment use BEARCATII, which restricts the characters to the blank character and the lower-case letters of the alphabet as follows: blank character is assigned the value 0. A, ..., Z are assigned the values 1, ..., 26, respectively.
